            <h3>After two years of Khan Academy, I have now moved to another platform! I tried out GitHub about six months ago, but I couldn't figure out how to use it properly. Now six months later, I have a little more knowledge about how GitHub works, and I was able to figure out the bascis. I have yet to release my first full game on GitHub, but one is in the works right now!</h3>

                <h3 id = 'began-txt'>The story starts when I was eleven years old. At the time I was using Khan Academy for math, and had never even heard of coding before. Then one day, after I had finished my math for the day, I stumbled upon a course on Khan Academy called 'Computer Programming'. My curiosity made me click on the link, and I watched the first two videos of the 'Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation'. From there I powered through about half of the course, before I hit a roadblock on the for loop video. It was also around this time that I discovered a game that someone had made. At the time, I hadn't thought that making a game was even possible on Khan Academy. Looking back, the game was pretty simple, and definitely not the greatest. However, I owe a lot to that game's maker for motavating me. :) You can find the game <a href = 'https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/space-dodge-a-game/5237611677417472'>here</a>.</h3>
