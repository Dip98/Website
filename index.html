            <h3>After two years of Khan Academy, I have now moved to another platform! I tried out GitHub about six months ago, but I couldn't figure out how to use it properly. Now six months later, I have a little more knowledge about how GitHub works, and I was able to figure out the bascis. I have yet to release my first full game on GitHub, but one is in the works right now!</h3>

                <h1>How it Began</h1>
                <h3 id = 'began-txt'>The story starts when I was eleven years old. At the time I was using Khan Academy for math, and had never even heard of coding before. Then one day, after I had finished my math for the day, I stumbled upon a course on Khan Academy called 'Computer Programming'. My curiosity made me click on the link, and I watched the first two videos of the 'Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation'. From there I powered through about half of the course, before I hit a roadblock on the for loop video. It was also around this time that I discovered a game that someone had made. At the time, I hadn't thought that making a game was even possible on Khan Academy. Looking back, the game was pretty simple, and definitely not the greatest. However, I owe a lot to that game's maker for motavating me. :) You can find the game <a href = 'https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/space-dodge-a-game/5237611677417472' target = 'blank'>here</a>.</h3>

                <h1>First Games<h1>
                <h3 id = 'games-txt'>Once I realized that you could make games with PJS, I ditched the Khan Academy tutorials and started looking into community made ones. The first game I attempted to make was a dodge game using <a href = 'https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_639291037700385781852565' target = 'blank'>Gray Wolfüê∫'s</a> tutorial. I somehow messed up in the process, but still learned from it. Then one night while eating dinner I had an idea for a game that would require very little coding skill, but still would be fun. The game was <a href = 'https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/conversation-a-game/5095614439276544' target = 'blank'>Conversation</a>, where the only mechanic was buttons. Looking back, the buttons were actually done very poorly, and were really very bad. But still, I had created my first game! From this first step I would go on to create the 45 games I have today.</h3>

                <h1>Popularity Boom</h1>
                <h3 id = 'boom-txt'>This was the golden era of my time of Khan Academy. I quickly made a subpage, and slowly but surely gained subscribers. I made my first real well-known game <a href = 'https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/infiltration-game/4553973199060992' target = 'blank'>INFILTRATION</a>. I learned more and more about coding, learning HTML, CSS and JS in addition to PJS. I then had the idea for a platformer with a twist, which would become the game <a href = 'https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/glitch-game/4773928902115328' target = 'blank'>GLITCH</a>. That game quickly reached over a 100 votes and had been slowly climbing ever since. Its immmense popularity made me decide to turn the game into a series, creating two other games which also gained popularity. However, as I learned more and more, I started wanting to make good 3D games. I at first tried to do that with P3D, but it was too laggy. I then tried to do it with Three.js, but it had weird animation bugs. I kept producing games and my popularity kept growing, but underlying all of that was a desire to make good, cool 3D games. </h3>
